dorecur
=======

*dorecur* is an add-on for the `todo.txt-cli
<https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/>`_ task manager that
provides a drop-in replacement for the *do* action. It handles
recurring tasks by adding a new task when the old task is finished. It
does not require an external scheduler such as cron.

-------------------------------
Keys (tags) used by this action
-------------------------------

- The ``rec:`` value specifies how the task recurs.

- The ``t:`` start (deferral/threshold) date, if it exists, is
  incremented as specified by the `rec:` value.

- The ``due:`` date, if it exists, is incremented as specified by the
  ``rec:`` value.

----------------
Recurrence types
----------------

*dorecur* supports two different recurrence types.

- *Normal recurrence* is suitable for a task that recurs based on the
  date of completion, such as "water the flowers".

- *Strict recurrence* is suitable for a task that recurs based on the
  start date and/or due date specified in the task, such as "pay
  rent".

------------------------
Recurrence specification
------------------------

The ``rec:`` value follows the format ``(+)X(d|b|w|m|y)``.

- Normal recurrence is indicated by omitting the ``+`` prefix. Include
  the ``+`` prefix to specify strict recurrence.

- ``X`` is an integer representing the magnitude of adjustment.

- An optional suffix indicates the time unit: days, business days,
  weeks, months, or years, respectively. The default is "days" if the
  suffix is omitted. Business day calculations ignore holidays. Month
  calculations simply increment the month and subtract days if
  necessary (see the last example in `Behavior`_, below).

--------
Behavior
--------

This section describes *dorecur's* exact behavior, with examples (and
abbreviated todo-txt output).

- No ``rec:`` key: the task is marked as completed and no new task is
  created. (The built-in todo-txt *do* action is executed directly.)

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Fix lamp
     $ todo-txt do 1
     (No new task)

- No start date or due date: a new task is created with no changes.

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Meet friend for tea rec:1
     $ todo-txt do 1
     1 Meet friend for tea rec:1

- A start date or a due date but not both: the adjustment is applied
  to the date given.

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Water flowers t:2021-01-01 rec:5d
     $ date -I && todo-txt do 1
     2021-01-02
     1 Water flowers t:2021-01-07 rec:5d

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Send birthday greeting to friend t:2021-04-04 rec:+1y
     $ todo-txt do 1
     1 Send birthday greeting to friend t:2022-04-04 rec:+1y

- Both start date and due date with *strict recurrence*: the
  adjustment is applied to both dates individually.

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Pay rent t:2021-01-28 due:2021-02-01 rec:+1m
     $ todo-txt do 1
     1 Pay rent t:2021-02-28 due:2021-03-01 rec:+1m

- Both start date and due date with *normal recurrence*: the
  adjustment is applied to the start date only. The due date is
  adjusted by applying the offset between the start date and due date
  of the original task (as number of days).

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Do offline backup t:2021-01-01 due:2021-01-08 rec:2w
     $ date -I && todo-txt do 1
     2021-01-03
     1 Do offline backup t:2021-01-17 due:2021-01-24 rec:2w

- A start or due date near the end of the month with a month unit for
  recurrence: a day-of-month greater than 28 may migrate backward
  toward the 28th.

  .. code:: console

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Get groceries t:2021-01-14 rec:1m
     $ date -I && todo-txt do 1
     2021-01-31
     1 Get groceries t:2021-02-28 rec:1m

     $ todo-txt ls
     1 Pay rent t:2021-01-31 due:2021-02-01 rec:+1m
     $ todo-txt do 1
     1 Pay rent t:2021-02-28 due:2021-03-01 rec:+1m

----------
Installing
----------

There are two ways to install *dorecur*.

- As a Git repository: clone the repository into the todo.txt-cli
  actions directory (``~/.todo.actions.d``, by default) and create a
  symlink. Future updates only require running ``git pull`` from
  inside the repository. Note that todo.txt-cli will ignore a broken
  symlinkâ€”see `todo.txt-cli issue #359
  <https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/issues/359>`_.

  .. code:: console

     $ cd ~/.todo.actions.d/
     $ git clone "https://github.com/owenh000/todo.txt-cli-dorecur.git"
     $ ln -s todo.txt-cli-dorecur/dorecur.py do

- As a single file: save the ``dorecur.py`` file to your todo.txt-cli
  actions directory (``~/.todo.actions.d/``, by default) and rename it
  to ``do``. This works in cases where Git and/or filesystem symlink
  support are unavailable.

Development

To run tests: ``./dorecur.py test``

Credits
-------

This add-on is inspired by:

- `todo.txt-cli <https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli>`_, for which
  *dorecur* is an add-on

- The `again <https://github.com/nthorne/todo.txt-cli-again-addon>`_
  add-on, which was written in Bash and has a slightly different
  feature set

- The recurrence system of the `topydo
  <https://github.com/topydo/topydo>`_ task manager (though the
  recurrence behavior of *dorecur* is not identical)
